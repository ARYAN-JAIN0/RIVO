# AFTER (CLARIFIED):
# Docker Compose configuration
# STATUS: PLACEHOLDER - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
#
# Future implementation will define:
# - PostgreSQL service (replacing CSV storage)
# - Redis service (for caching/pub-sub)
# - Ollama service (for LLM inference)
# - Application service (FastAPI)
#
# For now, use direct Python execution:
#   python app/orchestrator.py
